So if start is not running, install python and the pip packages with the install script. If you have python, use pip to install tabulate and tqdm. The scripts are .cmd files, but if you don't have command prompt change the extension to .sh and that should work. It would be nice to have an exe for this! You should be able to run the shell scripts just by clicking on them... which is almost like having an execuatble binary if you squint... neat!
