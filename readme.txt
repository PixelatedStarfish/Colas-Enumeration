-What is Cola's Enumeration?-

You might be wondering who Cola is. Cola is a Yorkshire Terrier, who is always ready for food, licking, and being carried. You might also be wondering what the Conway-Weschler System is, and why I felt the need to extend it with this enumeration. May this document answer your questions. May you find this document, and its accompanying program, to be as illuminating and enjoyable as I do.

"Cola's Enumeration for Naming Large Numbers: An Extension of the Conway-Wechsler System with Truncation of Contiguous Repeating Substrings" is a counting machine for naming arbitrarily large natural numbers. It is based on the Conway-Weschler System. which can also name arbitrarily large natural numbers with Latin numerals. However, in the Conway-Weschler System the length of names grows rapidly, and names are quickly populated with redundant syllables. For instance, "Millinillinillinillion" has three contiguous "nilli"s, and four "illi"s. Cola's Enumeration truncates this redundancy without loss of information.

-Conway's illion Converter and the Conway-Weschler System-

The Conway-Weschler System is an enumeration created by John Conway, Richard Guy, and Allan Weschler. It was initially published in "The Book of Numbers", written by Conway and Guy in 1995. It was then extended by Conway and Weschler in 1996. Conway's illion Converter, created by Fish in 2021, is a program to automate this system.

So, what is an "illion"? An "illion" is a named with the suffix "illion", in the Conway-Weschler system. These include one million, one billion, one trillion, etc. Fish refers to these numbers as "illion"s, such that "million" is the first "illion", billion is the second, trillion is the third. The Conway-Weschler system extends this "illion" naming convention arbitrarily, by employing Latin numerals in the following manner. 

Given one million (named for a thousand thousands) is considered the "first illion", one billion is the "second illion", and one trillion is the "third illion" then "illions" from the second to the 999th can be named as a portmanteau of a Latin numeral and "(m)illion". The "bi" of billion and "tri" of trillion are consistent with this convention. (See the Sources for a list of Latin numerals.) At the "thousandth illion", this convention would appear to be exhausted. The prefix "milli" would refer to one thousand, but it is already in use by "million", so "millinillion" was coined to allow for further enumerating.

The next "illion", for 1001, would be millimillion. Continuing to the "two thousandth illion", we reach "billinillion". By combining a Latin numeral with the suffix "illinillion", it is possible to enumerate up to the "999,000th illion" by the same method for enumerating to the "999th illion".

The Conway-Weschler system use two "illi"s for the "nillions", which I find a bit verbose. Consider the "999,999th illion", which is called "novenonagintanongentilli-novenonagintanongentillion". "Novenonagintanongentilli" is already a long name, and it gets repeated in this case. What is next? The "millionth illion", which is called "millinillinillion".  Like Cerberus' three heads, this number has three "illi"s. As numbers grow higher, the "illi"s and the Latin just keep piling up, out to infinity!


--How Does Cola's Enumeration Work?--

-Truncation by use of Greek Numerals-

Cola's Enumeration uses Greek numerals (also used for naming polygons) to truncate contiguous, repeated substrings in "illion" numbers, which are named exclusively with Latin numerals in the Conway-Weschler system.

A string composed of the contiguous repeated substring "nilli" looks like this:
    "nillinillinillinillinilli"

The five "nilli"s of this substring can be truncated to "pentanillion" in Cola's Enumeration, with "penta" refering to the Greek numeral for five. Millinillinillinillinillinillion in the Conway-Weschler system is enumerated as millpentanillion in Cola's Enumeration.

(In practice, only repeated groups of 3 digits, which are also contiguous, are truncated. 999,999,888-illion does not share a name with 999,888,999,888-illion.)

-Examples of Greek Prefixes-

    hena      - 1
    di        - 2
    tris      - 3
    tetra     - 4
    penta     - 5
    hexa      - 6
    hepta     - 7
    okta      - 8 (pronounce the first syllable like "oak")
    nona      - 9
    deka      - 10
    undeka    - 11
    dodeka    - 12
    trisdeka  - 13
    tetradeka - 14
    icosa     - 20
    triconta  - 30
    hecta     - 100
    kilo      - 1000
    

I would like to note that I chose prefixes that were distinct and familiar over ones that were strictly accurate to ancient greek numerals. I chose the most common, simple, and distinct numerals to maximize ease of reading. I also made trivial adaptations to reduce edge cases and improve program efficiency. 

I swapped "deca" for "deka" to distinguish it from "deci". I made use of metric prefixes wherever possible ("kilo" over "chilla"). To save edge cases, I dropped "myria" for "dekakilo" and switched "hecto" to "hecta". I changed the Greek "tri" to "tris" (from the numeral for 13) to distinguish it from the Latin "tri".

Take a look at the tables for more information.


-Going Even Further Beyond: Polymetric Combinations and Enumerating Contiguous Quettas-

Suppose you have embarked on a quest to count all of the natural numbers. "One, two, three", you begin. You have already acquired your immortality; you have adventured throughout the jungles, the cities, the deserts, and the seas, and lived thousands of lives. You have studied under the gurus and mastered the 72 transformations. You have seen the empires rise and fall like waves on the water. You have named every bird on every branch of every tree, and all the creatures of the lands and waters. Now you take a breath and count the stars, until each of the skies of the earth are entirely numbered. You leap skyward, and take a vantage point in the heavens. You see new stars, and continue counting. Well beyond the millions, and the vigintillions, and the millnillions, you are counting. You admire stars, pulsars, and quasars, and you are still counting. Milkilonillion has long since passed, as have the megas, and the gigas, the teras. You enumerate the stars across clusters of galaxies, by the zettas, and yottas. In search of the edge of reality, you keep counting, but you quickly arrive at millquettanillion. You are out of Latin numerals, and Greek numerals. What now?

By combining prefixes, larger numbers can be counted. Quetta is the metric prefix equivalent to 10^30, it is the largest metric prefix to date. Given kilo is 10^3, 10^33 can be described as kiloquetta. However, "quettaquetta" would not be far behind, and "quettaquettaquetta" not much farther. What should be done with these repeating "quetta"s?

To truncate these contiguous quettas, count the number of "quetta"s as a Latin numeral, and swap out the "quetta"s for your Latin and a single "quetta".  By this method, "diquetta" is 10^30 * 2, and "biquetta" is 10^30 squared. For another example, "millquettaquettaquettaquettaquettanillion" is better written as millkaiquinquettanillion, and better pronounced as mill-kai-quin-quetta-nillion. Note that "kai" here is Greek for "and". Why is "kai" here? Well, suppose we have a number with a thousand "quetta"s. As "bi" is taken from billion, "millni" is taken from "millnillion". The thousand "quetta" number  would be written as "millkaimillniquettanillion"; "kai" separates the two "mill"s neatly.

After much experimenting. I have decided this was too difficult to implement and test with any reliability. The numbers discussed here are too large to be generated in a timely manner and, the most I can do is generate some of the smaller "poly-quetta" Greek prefixes.
 
--Program Implementation--

-Comparing Enumerations-

Cola's Enumeration and Conway's illion Converter were compared for computing time, and output length, over a range of inputs from 1 to 3,000,000. The following was generated: 

-Stats for Cola's Enumeration-

Average Enumeration Time:   2.644346e-06 seconds
Average Enumeration Length: 48.824 characters

Maximum Enumeration Time:   0.004 seconds
Maximum Enumeration Length: 74 characters

-Stats for Conway's illion Converter-

Average Enumeration Time:   1.343678e-06 seconds
Average Enumeration Length: 50.512 characters

Maximum Enumeration Time:   0.003 seconds
Maximum Enumeration Length: 77 characters


Predictably, Cola's Enumeration is generally slower, but produces shorter output. This is expected behavior, because Cola's Enumeration performs addtional computations, specifically to shorten output length.

-Limitations of this Program-

- Numbers without repeating contiguous substrings in their respective enumerations will still
  be described with at least one syllable for each non-zero digit. 

- millkillonillion is the largest value possible to generate as of version 1.4. This prevents intensive calculations.

- There may still be bugs or duplicated names. The space of all inputs too large to test
  exhaustively. 

- Hyper E notation is not extended beyond one octothorpe.

-Features-

- A menu with options for experimenting with Cola's Enumeration and Conway's illion Converter.

- A parser for interpreting inputs expressed with arithmetic operations.

- Output with engineering notation and "Hyper E" notation.

- Tables of numbers.

- Enumeration of random input.

- Implementations of short scale and long scale enumerations.

--Conclusion--

-The Foggy Journey to Fish: Wikis, Blogs, and Citogenesis-

While coming to develop this enumeration has been a joy. I do feel the need to critique the various "illion" series on blogs, websites, and wikis that helped inspire this project. Before I learned of the Conway-Weschler system and Conway's illion converter, I was bouncing around on the Googology wiki, the Massive Numbers wiki, and the Gugology wiki, which I had found by chance. From tab to tab, I found various  notations for describing large numbers, lists of named "illions", novel schemes and magnitudes, and lists of tiers to classify numbers. These contributions, though intriguing, were also in conflict. For example, the Googology wiki page for the "thousandth illion" names this number "millinillion" (as in the Conway-Weschler system) but it also includes names like "millillion", "milliatillion", "milletillion", and "platillion". While I can understand the fun of coining names for these large numbers. I question the pedagogical value of various authors arbitrarily naming various large numbers on a blog or wiki, and compiling the (conflicting) results. 

I understand the apparent irony of this questioning, having just written another numbering system for my own fun, and potentially adding to the confusion. That said, googology has developed a "citogenesis" problem (a term describing the memetic growth of citations, to the point of obfuscating the origin of information, by proliferation and indirection). Take "micrillion", as coined by Johnathan Bowers. This number can be found on his blog with other numbers he has coined. There are wikis citing the blog, and there are forum posts citing the wikis, and there also youtube videos linking to other numbers and blog posts and wikis. As of writing, there are thousands of search engine results for "micrillion", parroting this term into veracity without the context of its creation. 

I understand that the Conway-Weschler system, with its endlessly growing number of "illi"s, is not always a practical convention for naming extremely large numbers, but the system is mathematically, and logically, consistent. Syllables are mapped to place values, and each is descriptive and purposeful (even if there is redundancy). The name of each number enumerated describes the number itself because each place value is described. It is trivial to define some finite "illion series" with powers of ten, and arbitrary wordplay, but such a system is only defined by the mapping of name to number. In the Conway-Weschler system, each number is named according to a mapping of syllables to place values. Cola's Enumeration is written to preserve this mapping.  

-To Appreciate Numbers Going Up-

So, you might be wondering why I did this: "Who is ever going to need anything like this?", "Why not just use engineering notation, scientific notation, or arrow notation?" Well, you can use this because it is fun. This is the numeric equivalent of a Rube-Goldberg machine, and that is all it needs to be.

Imagine yourself with a great deal of time on your hands. The year is 2023. You had a nondescript operation, and you have left your tutoring job to go on a medical leave. You pick up a new video game to pass the time. It is the kind of game with a bunch of numbers going up; the kind of game where you can click on some stuff, and go to sleep, and come back to find the numbers have gone up, and now you can spend number (yes, number) to get the mcguffin that makes the numbers go up more quickly. You contemplate strategies for making the numbers go up faster. You visit fan pages and wikis for tips and tricks, for slaying the angry number titans, so you can make the numbers go up faster. The game displays numbers with a suffix by default, (such as "6.283 Million") and as the numbers rise from millions to vigintillions, you become curious as to how the dev has named so many numbers. 

You find a list of large numbers on Wikipedia, a few wikis dedicated to naming numbers, and finally Conway's illion Converter. You push it as high as it will let you, and notice the repeating "illi"s on your screen. In the interest of numeric mischief, you decide to play a numeric joke. You think to yourself "maybe I can write a fork, that names some of these illions 'gazillion' or 'jillion', like in that one episode of Futurama, where Phillip J. Fry bids 'one jillion dollars' at auction, and is met with the reply 'Sir, that's not a real number'." It would be funny if jillion was actually a real, defined number. Things like that are funny when you are on painkillers. So, you make some alterations. Funny stuff. However, the Number-Goblin-that-lives-in-your-head-now is not satisfied with this. 

You remember that English has words for shapes in it. Polygons are named with ancient Greek instead of ancient Latin. You can do something with that. So you do something with that, counting the Latin "illi"s with Greek numerals, and it becomes an enumeration that you can name after your older-brother's-college-roomate's-dog-but-sometimes-also-your-family-dog-because-your-family-is-happy-to-sit. How could anyone resist the opportunity to name something after their beloved family dog? So you decide to write the enumeration and name it after the dog. 



Anyway, have fun with this thing!

--Changelog--

-1.4-

(Been a year, how time flies...)

Fixed some typos, but that is never done. Made minor revision to the readme.

"killo" is corrected to "kilo"

switched greek 8 to okta (as in oak) to avoid confusion with octo.

Added another to "milnillion" so it is now millnillion. This applies to all derivative numbers as well. This should make long names easier to parse, such that each subsequent "ll" describes one thousand Latin enumerations each.

Also added a maximum of 10^3000 for input (min -10^3000) in order to prevent calculations from taking too long. Python has  been updated to prevent cyberattacks by limiting conversions between strings and integers greater than 4300 digits long. 


-v1.3-

added an "l" to "minillion" and company. Now "milnillion".

Changed Greek "tri" to "tris" to distinguish it form Latin "tri" ("tris" is easier to pronounce than tria").

inputs 103 and 300 had the same output, this was due to a block that had remained indented to deeply after removing the clasues for the "modified" system. 

Removed a stubborn bug. The output "centillion" was repeated for 101 - 109.
This persisted for each hundred.

Added a test to identify these duplications. Iterate, and if I(n) = I(n + 1) break. This is a linear time test, which allows for a search over many inputs.

-v1.2-

Changed "tria" to "tri" for simplicity
Implemented long scale
Modified names such that each has only one "illi"
Greatly simplified the "supermetric" portion of this project. (I had to break some easter eggs.)

Inputs less than one are supported

Updated tables and menu options accordingly

Removed "Boring" and "Wacky" tests

-v1.1-

Optimized parsing, now digits are parsed instead of strings.
This reduces the required parsing significantly.
Additional "on's" are also no longer required. 

Added speed tests, "Boring" and "Wacky".
One is for typical inputs, powers of ten and the like.
The wacky one had a bug that produced all sorts of crazy numbers people do not think about, the perfect edge case generator.

Various optimizations and bug fixes.
The time to process 10^10^4 has dropped from over 30 seconds to less than a quarter of a second on my machine.

-v1.0-
